        <h2>When did GPT start?</h2>
        <p>
          GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is based on the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the seminal paper 
          <em>"Attention Is All You Need"</em> by Vaswani et al., published in June 2017. This paper laid the foundation for models like GPT by introducing the self‑attention mechanism that allows models to process and generate text more efficiently.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-attention formula:</h3>
        <pre>
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QKᵀ) / √dₖ) V
